Contamination in water distribution systems (WDSs) poses a significant risk to public health. However the inherent challenges of determining optimal flushing durations as part of a response strategy. The developed model calculates contaminant travel trajectories within the network by discretizing the one-dimensional advection equation. Despite focusing on simplified scenarios with no contaminant reactions in this preliminary study, the model proves effective in de-termining flushing durations. Validation through simulation studies and a laboratory Testbed underscores its efficacy, providing valuable insights for practical applications and serving as an indispensable reference for water utility companies in addressing contamination incidents.
